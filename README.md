# USRP_prototype_for_channel_statistics_estimation

This repository contains the following:

1) USRP_RX folder: contains the source code for the USRP receiver (which is configured as a SU) with instructions on how to build and run the program.
2) USRP_TX folder: contains the source code for the USRP transmitter (which is configured as a PU) with instructions on how to build and run the program.
3) TX: executable GUI for the transmitter
4) RX: executable GUI for the receiver
5) README.md

The executable GUI files (TX & RX) are designed to ease the configuration of this prototype without the need to refer to the source code. They can run on Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu). If you are using Windows you may run the code in the Archive.zip from the terminal window.

More details on the functionality of this prototype will be added later once the paper submitted for this project is accepted.

# USRP_prototype_for_channel_statistics_estimation

This repository contains the following:

1) USRP_TX folder: contains the source code for the USRP transmitter (to be configured as a PU) with instructions on how to build and run the program.
2) USRP_RX folder: contains the source code for the USRP receiver (to be configured as a SU) with instructions on how to build and run the program.
3) TX: executable GUI for the transmitter
4) RX: executable GUI for the receiver
5) README.md

The executable GUI files (TX & RX) are designed to ease the configuration of this prototype without the need to refer to the source code. They can run on Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu) after building the transmitter and receiver programs as explained inside USRP_TX and USRP_RX folders. If you are using a different operating system (e.g., Windows or Mac), you may run the code from the terminal window, which is also explained inside USRP_TX and USRP_RX folders.

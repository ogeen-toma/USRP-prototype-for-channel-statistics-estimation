ReceptionTime = 10.0

# Time (in seconds) elapsed between consecutive sensing events (i.e., sensing period) [double]
Ts = 0.200

# Time (in seconds) spent sensing the channel (i.e., capturing signal samples) [double]
# Typically tau = 0.1*Ts or similar.
tau = 0.0001

# Value of the decision threshold for energy detection [double]
# To set the value of this parameter, first set the configuration parameters as desired.
# Then run the program for a sufficiently long period of time without any signal present
# (i.e., the transmitter should be off). The captured samples will be noise. Such samples
# can be processed to determine the decision threshold (for example, for PFA 1%, etc.).
# Notice that changing some configuration parameters may result in a change of the
# observed noise statistics. Therefore, every time the configuration parameters are
# changed, this process should be repeated to find the new decision threshold.
# See parameter DisplayEnergyStats for more details on how to set the threshold.
# NOTE: A value of -1 indicates that the threshold has not been set yet. The program
# can operate with this value. Any other negative value will produce an error.
DecisionThreshold = 0.05

# The test mode displays a figure with the instantaneous received energy
# This is useful to see the typical energy levels received for a particular
# configuration and find a suitable value for the decision threshold.
# NOTE: This will slow down the receiver and may prevent real-time operation,
# therefore this should be disabled when the actual experiment takes place.
# NOTE: Gnuplot needs to be installed in the computer to show the figure.
# NOTE: Gnuplot5 will show some error messages. Only Gnuplot is needed.
# 0 = Test mode is OFF
# 1 = Test mode is ON
TestMode = 1

# Displays statistics of the sensed energy values
# This can be useful to set the decision threshold. To this end, the program
# should be run without any signal present (the transmitter should be off).
# The measured energy values will correspond to noise only and the statistics
# displayed can be used to select the decision threshold. For example, for a
# perfect sensing without false alarms, the threshold can be set well above
# the maximum (noise) energy value displayed. The program also displays the
# values for the decision threshold that provide a probability of false alarm
# (PFA) of 1% (99% percentile), 5% (95% percentile) and 10% (90% percentile)
# (such values are valid when only noise is present, without signals).
# Other more complex strategies can be applied by processing the measured
# energy levels, which can be saved for offline post-processing (see below).
# 0 = Energy statistics are not displayed
# 1 = Energy statistics are displayed

# Shows in real-time the values of the detected busy/idle periods
# NOTE: Printing the durations of the detected periods in the screen
# will lead to some additional delay that will affect the ability of
# the receiver to operate in real-time. This option can be used for
# testing or debugging but should be deactivated for the final experiment.

# Center frequency in Hz [double]
# NOTE: The frequency range of the USRP B200mini is between [70 MHz - 6 GHz]
CenterFrequency = 433.93e6

# The analog frontend filter bandwidth in Hz [double]
# NOTE: The ISM radio band of 433.92MHz center frequency has 1.74 MHz bandwidth (433.05-434.79)MHz.
# Therefore, it is important to set the USRP frontend filter bandwidth to 1.74 MHz to avoid 
# detecting undesired (out-of-band) signals from the neighbouring bands whilst letting through the
# cleanest possible desired signal.
Bandwidth = 1.74e6

# Desired ADC sample rate in Hz (number of complex I/Q samples per second) [double]
# USRP B200mini master clock rate can be set upto 61.44 MHz. However, the analog frontend filter 
# bandwidth is limited to 56 MHz maximum and 200 kHz minimum. Therefore, it is recommended to
# set the sample rate between [200 kHz â€“ 56 MHz]
SampleRate = 56000000


# Desired tuner gain in dB [double]
# Applies when EnableTunerAGC = 0
# USRP B200mini receive frontend gain has upto 89.8 dB of available gain.
